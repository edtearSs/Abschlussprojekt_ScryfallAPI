21.9.2023 1. create python files for the project
	- main is supposed to be the streamlit overview
	- naive_bayes is supposed to be the code that entails all the 
	machine learning aspects to use the data for
	- scryfallAPI adds the scryfall API to the project as a JSON file.
21.09.2023 2. added code to load data with the API
21.09.2023 3. added data.py for functions using the extracted data
21.09.2023 4. added API use for single card search and addes search bar for single card search
21.09.2023 5. added bulk data function to scryfallAPI.py
21.09.2023 6. added get_dataframe function to naive_bayes.py
21.09.2023 7. added filter to the dataframe
21.09.2023 !!! Filter not working correctly, problem probably with the JSON file?
21.09.2023 8. Fixed filter not working correctly
25.09.2023 1. changing WUBRG +C in colors to Indexes 0-5 in naive_bayes.py analyze function
25.09.2023 2. removed unnecessary code in main.py
25.09.2023 3. changed dataframe filtering to not include multicolored and colorless magic cards to simplify the data for the algorithm
25.09.2023 4. updated analyze() function to correctly train the model for the project
26.09.2023 1. Field-Tested specific cards for the algorithm --> Accuracy way higher than the model accuracy shows.
27.09.2023 1. Tried Figuring out how to change the the dataframe to use it with sns.pairplot without changing too much... Couldn't figure it out even after working on it for 5 hours. discarded changes
